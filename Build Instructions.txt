For each Target type:

1.	Build DSF Core PPL

	a. 	Open the target build project in <repo root>\Core
	b. 	Execute the build spec
	c. 	The Core PPL will be output to C:\Builds\Data Sharing Framework\<Target>\Core
	
2.	Build DSF Components

	a. 	For each target type, copy the DSF Core PPL that was the output of step 1 into <repo root>\Components
	b. 	Open the target build project for each component located in <repo root>\Components
	c. 	Check that nothing is broken by mass compiling the project (right-click project > Mass compile). Things will be broken if the Core PPL type does not match the target type
	d. 	Execute the build spec
	e. 	The Component PPLs will be output to C:\Builds\Data Sharing Framework\<Target>\Components
	
3. Build DSF Custom Device

	a. 	For each target type, copy the DSF Core PPL that was the output of step 1 into <repo root>\VeriStand\Data Sharing Custom Device\Source
	b. 	Open the custom device project for the same target type
	c. 	Check that nothing is broken by mass compiling the project (right-click project > Mass compile). Things will be broken if the Core PPL type does not match the target type
	d. 	Execute the following builds:
			Windows
				Configuration Release
				Engine Release
			Other
				Engine Release
			
4. (Optional) Copy Component PPLs built in step 2 to the custom device folder. This step only matters if you want to run the custom device with actual components.

	a. 	Navigate to the built VeriStand custom device folder.
			- C:\Users\Public\Documents\National Instruments\NI VeriStand 20XX\Custom Devices\Data Sharing Framework
	b. 	For each Target type, copy the Components folder from the output of step 2 into its corresponding custom device Target folder.
			- The custom device looks here for components to dynamically load based on the user configuration.
